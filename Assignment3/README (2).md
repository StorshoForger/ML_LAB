# Machine Learning Lab - Experiment 3

This repository contains implementations of machine learning experiments in Python, prepared from Jupyter Notebook (`Modified_mllaba3_(1).ipynb`).

## 📌 Overview
The notebook demonstrates machine learning workflows such as:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Performance evaluation
- Visualization of results

These experiments are part of coursework for learning **Python-based Machine Learning** techniques.

## ⚙️ Requirements
Install the required Python packages before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

You will also need **Jupyter Notebook** or **Jupyter Lab** to run the `.ipynb` file:

```bash
pip install notebook jupyterlab
```

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Modified_mllaba3_(1).ipynb"
```
   or
```bash
jupyter lab "Modified_mllaba3_(1).ipynb"
```

3. Run the cells step by step to reproduce the results.
