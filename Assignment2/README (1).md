# Machine Learning Lab - Experiment 2

This repository contains implementations of machine learning experiments in Python, prepared from Jupyter Notebook (`mllaba2.ipynb`).

## 📌 Overview
The experiments include preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization using datasets commonly applied in machine learning coursework.

## ⚙️ Requirements
Install the required Python packages before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

You will also need **Jupyter Notebook** or **Jupyter Lab** to run the `.ipynb` file.

```bash
pip install notebook jupyterlab
```

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "mllaba2 (2) (1).ipynb"
```
   or
```bash
jupyter lab "mllaba2 (2) (1).ipynb"
```

3. Run the cells step by step to see results.
